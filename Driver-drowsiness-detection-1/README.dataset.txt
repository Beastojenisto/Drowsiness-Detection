# Overview
The Drowsiness dataset is a collection of images of a person in a vehicle (Ritesh Kanjee, of Augmented Startups) simulating "drowsy" and "awake" facial postures. This dataset can easily be used as a benchmark for a "driver alertness" or "driver safety" computer vision model.

# Training and Deployment
The Drowsiness model has been trained with Roboflow Train, and available for inference on the Dataset tab. We have also trained a YOLOR model for robust detection and tracking of a fatigued driver.  You can learn more here:  https://augmentedstartups.info/YOLOR-Get-Started
