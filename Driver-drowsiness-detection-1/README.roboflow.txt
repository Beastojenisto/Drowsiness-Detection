The dataset includes 1230 images.
2 are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Fit (white edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random shear of between -5째 to +5째 horizontally and -5째 to +5째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
